# What is KoKoKo ?

Kokoko is the sound we make while visiting a friend or a relative, to know if we can get in.

With the current situation, we realized how difficult it is to find updated information to travel across African countries. This websites aims to gather all these information into one easy place.

We recommend to only travel for necessary purposes, so as to avoid spreading Covid-19 across the continent.

## Where do the data come from ?

We have gathered data from several databases:
